special move concepts:

sonic - sonic locks onto a player and homing attacks into them
this can easily be blocked or parried, but its a really quick move

tails - tails can tackle enemies/allies and fly with them
the enemy/ally will be stunned for a second

if tails presses fire he will slam the player into the ground
if tails presses toss flag he will throw the player far out

knuckles - knuckles will grab a boulder from the ground and throw it
this cant be blocked but it can be parried by attacking it before it hits you

amy - amy will use her hammer to dig opponents into the ground

funnily enough, only sonic can parry it. if he does, sonic will grab amys hammer and dig her into the ground instead

fang - fang will call a miniature airstrike on an opponent

itll be a small toy plane with a toy tails flying it, and itll drop small bombs

metal sonic - he will unleash a (sonic) blast
